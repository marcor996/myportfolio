  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>I was born and raised in Bosnia and Herzegovina. After finishing high school, I moved to Germany to live and work. Over the years, I worked in various jobs until I discovered my passion for coding.
    Since 2023, I have been studying as a Media Designer for Digital and Print, where I have strengthened my passion for this profession. Through my studies and hands-on experience, I continue to develop my skills and creativity in the field of digital media and design.</p>
